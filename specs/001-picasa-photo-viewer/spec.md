## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines

- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story

A Windows user wants to quickly view and browse through image files in a folder. They double-click an image file and expect a fast, lightweight viewer to open displaying the image with thumbnail navigation at the bottom. They can navigate between images using keyboard shortcuts or clicking thumbnails, zoom and pan for detail viewing, and switch to fullscreen mode for immersive viewing.

### Acceptance Scenarios

1. **Given** a folder contains multiple image files, **When** user double-clicks any image file, **Then** the viewer opens in fullscreen showing that image with thumbnails of all folder images at the bottom
2. **Given** the viewer is open with an image displayed, **When** user presses left/right arrow keys, **Then** the viewer navigates to previous/next image in the folder
3. **Given** an image is displayed, **When** user scrolls mouse wheel over the image, **Then** the image zooms in/out centered on the mouse cursor position
4. **Given** an image is zoomed in, **When** user drags the image, **Then** the image pans to show different areas
5. **Given** the viewer is open, **When** user presses F11, **Then** the viewer toggles between fullscreen and windowed mode
6. **Given** the viewer is displaying thumbnails, **When** user hovers mouse over the image area or thumbnails, **Then** thumbnails change from 50% to 100% opacity
7. **Given** the viewer is open, **When** user presses ESC, **Then** the application closes

### Edge Cases

- What happens when image files are corrupted or unsupported? Display error icon and allow navigation to skip
- How does system handle very large image files? Progressive loading and memory management within 500MB limit
- What occurs when files are deleted while viewer is open? Remove from thumbnail bar and auto-navigate to next available image
- How does navigation work with only one image in folder? Thumbnails show single image, navigation keys do nothing
- What happens when cache directory is not writable? Fallback to memory-only thumbnail storage

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements

#### Core Image Display

- **FR-001**: System MUST display JPEG, PNG, and WebP image files with automatic fit-to-window sizing
- **FR-002**: System MUST maintain image aspect ratio during display and resizing
- **FR-003**: System MUST support GIF files with automatic animation playback
- **FR-004**: System MUST display images on black background for optimal viewing contrast

#### Navigation and User Interface

- **FR-005**: System MUST display horizontal thumbnail bar at bottom showing 30√ó30 pixel thumbnails of all folder images
- **FR-006**: System MUST center current image thumbnail in the thumbnail bar with empty space padding for first/last images
- **FR-007**: System MUST adjust thumbnail bar opacity to 50% when mouse is not hovering over image or thumbnails, 100% when hovering
- **FR-008**: System MUST display image information overlay showing filename and dimensions in format "{filename} ({width} √ó {height})"
- **FR-009**: System MUST support navigation using left/right arrow keys to move between previous/next images
- **FR-010**: System MUST support thumbnail clicking to jump directly to any image in the folder
- **FR-011**: System MUST support mouse wheel scrolling over thumbnails for image navigation

#### Zoom and Pan Functionality

- **FR-012**: System MUST support zoom range from 10% to 2000% of original image size

### Key Entities *(include if feature involves data)*

- **Image File**: Represents a displayable image file with path, dimensions, format, and loading state
- **Thumbnail**: Cached 30√ó30 pixel preview of image file with generation timestamp and storage location
- **Folder Context**: Collection of all supported image files in the current directory with navigation order
- **View State**: Current zoom level, pan position, fullscreen mode, and selected image index
- **Cache Entry**: Stored thumbnail data with file hash, generation time, and expiration tracking
